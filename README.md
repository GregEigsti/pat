# Pat Docker
Pat WinLink Client in a Docker container

To build the Docker image

`docker build -t pat:1.0 .`

To run the Docker container. This will give you a command prompt within the container.

`docker run -v $PWD/config:/root/.wl2k:rw -p 8080:8080 --rm -it pat:1.0 /bin/bash`

To configure Pat

`pat configure`

To run Pat HTTP server

`pat http`

Your pat configuration should be saved to the config folder of your host machine. This
folder is created for you by 'docker run' due to the '-v $PWD/config:/root/.wl2k:rw'
flag. The config folder will contain your user settings as well as mailboxes and will
be reused as long as you launch the container from the same place.
